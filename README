Cilk program for finding a Hamiltonian cycle in a modular Gray graph.
Created by jfan for CS49 Parallel Algorithms.

usage: GrayHamiltonian [radices] -n [sequence length] -v [verbosity] 
     [radices]: a string of mixed or fixed integer radices encased in
                quotation marks and delimited by spaces.
                e.g. GrayHamiltonian "2 3 4"

     -n [sequence length]: (optional) an integer sequence length,
                required if we decide to perform a Gray Hamiltonian
                search only on that particular value of n. Otherwise,
                the program will perform the search on all possible
                values of n starting from n=2 and going to n=(product
                of the radices).  
		e.g. GrayHamiltonian "2 3 4" -n 13

     -v [verbosity]: (optional) changes the verbosity from default 2,
                which for each value of n prints a progress bar and,
                if no Hamiltonian cycle is found, an appropriate alert
                with the search status.
		e.g. GrayHamiltonian "2 3 4" -v 3

		-v 1 outputs only the values of n for which there is
                     no Hamiltonian cycle
		-v 2 outputs the above, plus progress bars and time 
		     lapse for each value of n tried
		-v 3 outputs the above, plus the Hamiltonian cycle if 
		     one is found
		-v 4 (not recommended) outputs the above, plus the 
		     stack trace as the recursive backtracking search
		     is running
